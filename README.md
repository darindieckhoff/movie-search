Movie Search App

Treehouse Capstone Project - This project utilizes the MEAN stack to allow the user to search movie information including soundtracks and videos. 
This app uses three seperate APIs to display information to the user using an Angular single page app.  Data about recent searches is stored in a MongoDB database.

***Due to OMBd becoming private this app is no longer functional***
